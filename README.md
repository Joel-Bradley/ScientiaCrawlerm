# Scientia Crawler

## Overview
The Scientia Crawler is a web crawler designed for the Scientia Ltd System. It allows you to convert university timetables into a JSON format for easier parsing and processing. This project is currently configured for the University of Birmingham, but it can be easily adapted for other institutions using the Scientia system.

## Usage

To use the Scientia Crawler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Update the URL to point to your institution's Scientia system index.
4. Run the crawler and obtain the converted JSON timetable.

## Customization

To customize the Scientia Crawler for your institution, simply replace the URL in the code with the index URL of your institution's Scientia system. This will allow the crawler to access and process the timetables specific to your university.
